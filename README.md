# CV Detection Backbones

This repository contains implementations and training experiments of popular object detection backbones using PyTorch, Detectron2, and Ultralytics.
The goal is to learn how modern object detection architectures are built, trained, and evaluated on datasets, while also comparing their performance across frameworks.

## Current Contents

* **YOLOv11** (Ultralytics)

---

## Planned Models

* Faster R-CNN
* RetinaNet
* SSD
* YOLO family (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, etc.)
* Other modern detectors

---

## Results

Each model will include:

* Training scripts or notebooks
* Dataset details
* Evaluation metrics (mAP, IoU, etc.)
* Screenshots or logs of training/validation results

---

## Tech Stack

* Python 3
* PyTorch
* Detectron2
* Ultralytics YOLO

---

## Purpose

This repository is for learning and practice. It is not production-ready, but rather a place to:

* Understand object detection architectures
* Compare different frameworks
* Document experiments and results
